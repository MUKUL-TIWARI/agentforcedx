##  Overview  
This repository contains the complete setup and configuration work I performed while completing **Salesforce Dream Quest 2025** — specifically the **Agentforce DX** project and **Slack Integration** project.

This journey involved:
- Connecting a special Agentforce Developer Edition org  
- Enabling Einstein, Agentforce, and Bots  
- Creating an Agentforce DX project  
- Generating metadata through Salesforce CLI  
- Connecting Salesforce with Slack  
- Activating the integration  
- Mapping and authorizing Slack users  
- Testing end-to-end communication between Slack and Salesforce  

This project was a **learning-based integration**, not a coding project.  
All metadata and folders were automatically generated using Salesforce tools (CLI, VS Code, Trailhead modules).
